# Introduction
This is a mini project of a graduate course, which aims to simulate load balancing with nulti-producer/multi-consumer systems using the following approaches: 
+ threads and shared memory;
+ processes and message passing.

# Requirements
In this project, it is required to solve the multi-producer/multi-consumer problem with a bounded buffer using the above approaches. 

# Design choices
